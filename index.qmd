The research group in Mathematical Statistics studies problems of algebraic statistics and planning of experiments, in particular graphical probabilistic models and optimal planning of experiments for large and big datasets; a recent line of research is on compositional data, investigating applications in the financial and biomedical fields, e.g. proteomic and genomic data, and developing algorithms and open-source software packages.
