abstract: "Real systems are characterized by complex patterns of interactions between their units, by dynamical processes on them, and by the interplay of the two. It is well known that particular structures affect dynamical processes at different scales. Sometimes richly connected units are connected by costly, long-range links. In the brain, hubs form rich clubs for integrating information between different brain regions, and many biological and social networks show this same structural organization. It remains, however, unclear whether this structural organization alone enables a rapid communication between highly connected nodes or whether a functional rich club may emerge as a combination of direct links and longer paths between rich nodes. Here, we identify functional rich clubs through the diffusion geometry, providing a perspective on rich-club phenomena in complex networks. We show that weak structural rich clubs may be functionally stronger, thanks to bridge nodes, while diffusion inside strong structural rich clubs may be damped in modular networks."

summary: "Many real systems (social groups, the brain, economic and transportation networks) display a particular organization of their hubs (nodes with a lot of connections): they are more densely connected among them than expected by chance. In other words, these rich nodes form clubs, called 'rich clubs'. How do these (structural) rich clubs reflect on dynamical processes taking place on the network? It depends on many aspects: of course, it depends on the dynamics, so here we focus on diffusion dynamics modelled through continuous-time random walks. Then, it also depends on which other types of structures are present in the network, and on their hierarchical relations. In brief: the presence of a strong structural does not imply the existence a strong functional rich club (easier diffusion among rich nodes). The vice versa is also true: functional rich clubs do not translate directly into denser connectivity among hubs. For more detail, and cool plots, see the paper!"
